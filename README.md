#### GameSense Credits
***Check specific class files for full credits.***
This client started out based off of FINZ0's Osiris, which in turn was based off of 086's KAMI. 
Without these projects, GameSense would not exist so a lot of credit is due to them for their work.

This client also implements the ClickGUI using PanelStudio: https://github.com/lukflug/PanelStudio/.
If you believe that we are using your code and credits are not properly given, please message Techale#1195 on Discord.

# From TechAle
Hi, it's the main dev of gs++.<br>
Developing gs++ had been really funny and, for who is wondering, the release date was decided for the 27^ December, i have no idea why Sable decided to release it 4 days before lol<br>
Why am i releasing it? Well, basically every gs++ users are quitting, so, i see no reasons why keeping this private.<br>
It also got boring developing in minecraft, and the last things i coded were bad+speed coded.<br>
For the last 2 months the client become a little bit instable, mostly because of bad things i added.<br>
"gs++ is held together by hot glue" - Historian<br>
I dont suggest to continue gs++, it's really not worth lol, start a client from 0 that is 100%  better.<br>
After this, i'll quit minecraft developement, i wont fork/star anything that is related to minecraft.<br>
If you want to follow me, just know that i'll start creating things that are not for minecraft, mostly university.<br>
